# Engineering Competencies

Work on engineering competencies including SOLID principles, agile, and important patterns and technologies.

## Focus

1. Strategy/Command Pattern (see the **StrategyAndCommand** project).
2. Architecture - Sequence, Logic
3. Fallacies of Distributed Copmuting
4. Concepts - parallel task library, circuit breaker, transient fault handling
5. Code craftmanship (upcoming course).

### Patterns/Concepts which should be employed/understood when calling external resources
